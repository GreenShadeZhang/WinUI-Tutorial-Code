This project was created using [Microsoft Windows Template Studio](https://aka.ms/wts).

## Getting Started
This app was built using WinUI 3 and Windows App SDK (previously known as Project Reunion).
Windows UI Library (WinUI) 3 is a native user experience (UX) framework for both Windows Desktop and UWP apps.

You're ready to build, deploy, and launch your app hitting F5. You can find the app entry point in the `App.xaml.cs` file. 
Add a breakpoint in the `OnLaunched` method and debug the code. Step into the `ActivationService` methods to understand the app lifecycle.

Don't forget to review the `developer TODOs` we've added for you. 
You can open the Task List using the menu `Views -> Task List`.

### Design pattern
This app uses MVVM Toolkit, for more information see https://aka.ms/mvvmtoolkit.

### Project type
This app uses Navigation Pane, for more information see [navigation pane docs](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsTemplateStudio/blob/dev/docs/UWP/projectTypes/navigationpane.md).

## Publish / Distribute

Use the [packaging project](http://aka.ms/msix) to create the app package to distribute your app and future updates. 
Right click on the packaging project and click `Publish -> Create App Packages...` to create an app package.
